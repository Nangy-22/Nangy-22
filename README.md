- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nangy-22
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and earning my Web Design and Development Diploma.
- 🔥 While I'm new to Web D&D, I come fully loaded with a serious background in Accounting, Business Management, Project Management, and Enterprise Risk Management. Coding is the next step in my career - which is my long-term professional journey determined by my passions.
- 🐤 I may be a young chick in the coding game, but I bring my career with me. I want to learn everything I can about coding!
